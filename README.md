# chain-and-retriever-chatbot


There are two main types of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbots:

1️⃣ Retriever + Chain Chatbot (like the one you're building)
2️⃣ Normal RAG Chatbot

Let’s break them down in detail.

# Retriever + Chain Chatbot 🚀
* How It Works:

Uses retrievers to fetch relevant documents.

Uses a chain to pass retrieved data to an LLM for answer generation.

Steps in a retrieval chain chatbot:

User enters a query.

The retriever searches a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone).

It fetches relevant documents based on similarity search.

The retrieved documents are passed to an LLM via a chain.

The LLM generates a final answer based on the documents.

### Example Code

retriever = db.as_retriever()  # Step 1: Convert vector database into a retriever

retrieval_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever, document_chain)  # Step 2: Create retrieval chain

response = retrieval_chain.invoke({"input": "What is Scaled Dot-Product Attention?"})  # Step 3: Run query

print(response['answer'])  # Step 4: Get the final answer


Pros ✅
✔️ More structured & modular (retriever + chain + LLM).
✔️ Better context filtering (retriever ensures only relevant docs are passed to the LLM).
✔️ More control over retrieval logic (custom retrievers, metadata filtering, etc.).

Cons ❌
✖️ Slightly slower because retrieval + response generation happens in steps.
✖️ Needs fine-tuning for good retrieval results.


# 2️⃣ Normal RAG Chatbot 💬
How It Works

Uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in a single step.

The retriever and LLM are combined directly (no chain logic).

LLM performs both retrieval and response generation at the same time.

### Example Code (Simple RAG Chatbot)

from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm, retriever=db.as_retriever())

response = qa_chain.run("What is Scaled Dot-Product Attention?")

print(response)
Pros ✅
✔️ Easier to set up (just connect retriever + LLM).
✔️ Faster in some cases (fewer steps involved).
✔️ Works out of the box without additional document processing.

Cons ❌
✖️ Less modular (retrieval + response generation are combined).
✖️ Harder to fine-tune retrieval logic.
✖️ May not handle complex queries well if the retrieved documents are not relevant.

🚀 Which One Should You Use?
Use Retriever + Chain Chatbot if you need fine-tuned retrieval & response generation.
Use Normal RAG Chatbot if you want a quick, easy-to-build chatbot.

📌 Difference Between create_stuff_documents_chain and create_retrieval_chain
Both create_stuff_documents_chain and create_retrieval_chain are LangChain components that process documents for LLMs, but they serve different purposes in the retrieval and response generation process.

1️⃣ create_stuff_documents_chain
This function combines documents into a single prompt and sends them to the LLM.

🔹 Code Example
python
Copy
Edit
from langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chain

document_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, prompt)
🔹 What is happening?
Takes an LLM (llm) and a prompt as input.
Directly combines the retrieved documents and feeds them into the prompt.
It follows a simple "stuffing" approach where all documents are put together in one input.
🔹 When to use?
When you have a small number of retrieved documents that fit into a single prompt.
When you want all the context in one go.
Works well if the LLM can handle large inputs.
2️⃣ create_retrieval_chain
This function creates a retrieval-based pipeline that fetches relevant documents before passing them to an LLM.

🔹 Code Example
python
Copy
Edit
from langchain.chains import create_retrieval_chain

retrieval_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever, document_chain)
🔹 What is happening?
Uses a retriever to fetch relevant documents based on the query.
Then, it passes the retrieved documents to document_chain (which then uses stuff_documents_chain).
Finally, the LLM generates a response based on those retrieved documents.
🔹 When to use?
When you have a large document set and only want to retrieve the most relevant ones.
When you need efficient search + response generation.
Works well for large knowledge bases or RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.
