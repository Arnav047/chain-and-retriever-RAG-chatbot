# chain-and-retriever-chatbot


There are two main types of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbots:

1️⃣ Retriever + Chain Chatbot (like the one you're building)
2️⃣ Normal RAG Chatbot

Let’s break them down in detail.

# Retriever + Chain Chatbot 🚀
How It Works
Uses retrievers to fetch relevant documents.
Uses a chain to pass retrieved data to an LLM for answer generation.
Steps in a retrieval chain chatbot:
User enters a query.
The retriever searches a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone).
It fetches relevant documents based on similarity search.
The retrieved documents are passed to an LLM via a chain.
The LLM generates a final answer based on the documents.
Example Code
python
Copy
Edit
retriever = db.as_retriever()  # Step 1: Convert vector database into a retriever

retrieval_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever, document_chain)  # Step 2: Create retrieval chain

response = retrieval_chain.invoke({"input": "What is Scaled Dot-Product Attention?"})  # Step 3: Run query

print(response['answer'])  # Step 4: Get the final answer
Pros ✅
✔️ More structured & modular (retriever + chain + LLM).
✔️ Better context filtering (retriever ensures only relevant docs are passed to the LLM).
✔️ More control over retrieval logic (custom retrievers, metadata filtering, etc.).

Cons ❌
✖️ Slightly slower because retrieval + response generation happens in steps.
✖️ Needs fine-tuning for good retrieval results.

# 2️⃣ Normal RAG Chatbot 💬
How It Works
Uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in a single step.
The retriever and LLM are combined directly (no chain logic).
LLM performs both retrieval and response generation at the same time.
Example Code (Simple RAG Chatbot)
python
Copy
Edit
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm, retriever=db.as_retriever())

response = qa_chain.run("What is Scaled Dot-Product Attention?")

print(response)
Pros ✅
✔️ Easier to set up (just connect retriever + LLM).
✔️ Faster in some cases (fewer steps involved).
✔️ Works out of the box without additional document processing.

Cons ❌
✖️ Less modular (retrieval + response generation are combined).
✖️ Harder to fine-tune retrieval logic.
✖️ May not handle complex queries well if the retrieved documents are not relevant.

🔍 Key Differences: Retriever + Chain vs. Normal RAG Chatbot
Feature	Retriever + Chain Chatbot	Normal RAG Chatbot
Retrieval Method	Uses a retriever + separate chain for better control	Uses retriever + LLM directly
Modularity	More modular (retriever, chain, LLM separate)	Less modular (retrieval & generation combined)
Flexibility	Allows custom chains (e.g., adding metadata filtering)	Less flexible (LLM controls retrieval)
Ease of Setup	Requires defining retriever + chain separately	Easier setup with RetrievalQA
Performance	Better retrieval quality but slightly slower	Faster but may retrieve less relevant data
🚀 Which One Should You Use?
Use Retriever + Chain Chatbot if you need fine-tuned retrieval & response generation.
Use Normal RAG Chatbot if you want a quick, easy-to-build chatbot.
