# chain-and-retriever-chatbot


There are two main types of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbots:

1️⃣ Retriever + Chain Chatbot (like the one you're building)
2️⃣ Normal RAG Chatbot

Let’s break them down in detail.

# Retriever + Chain Chatbot 🚀
* How It Works:

Uses retrievers to fetch relevant documents.

Uses a chain to pass retrieved data to an LLM for answer generation.

Steps in a retrieval chain chatbot:

User enters a query.

The retriever searches a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone).

It fetches relevant documents based on similarity search.

The retrieved documents are passed to an LLM via a chain.

The LLM generates a final answer based on the documents.

### Example Code

retriever = db.as_retriever()  # Step 1: Convert vector database into a retriever

retrieval_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever, document_chain)  # Step 2: Create retrieval chain

response = retrieval_chain.invoke({"input": "What is Scaled Dot-Product Attention?"})  # Step 3: Run query

print(response['answer'])  # Step 4: Get the final answer


Pros ✅
✔️ More structured & modular (retriever + chain + LLM).
✔️ Better context filtering (retriever ensures only relevant docs are passed to the LLM).
✔️ More control over retrieval logic (custom retrievers, metadata filtering, etc.).

Cons ❌
✖️ Slightly slower because retrieval + response generation happens in steps.
✖️ Needs fine-tuning for good retrieval results.


# 2️⃣ Normal RAG Chatbot 💬
How It Works

Uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in a single step.

The retriever and LLM are combined directly (no chain logic).

LLM performs both retrieval and response generation at the same time.

### Example Code (Simple RAG Chatbot)

from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm, retriever=db.as_retriever())

response = qa_chain.run("What is Scaled Dot-Product Attention?")

print(response)
Pros ✅
✔️ Easier to set up (just connect retriever + LLM).
✔️ Faster in some cases (fewer steps involved).
✔️ Works out of the box without additional document processing.

Cons ❌
✖️ Less modular (retrieval + response generation are combined).
✖️ Harder to fine-tune retrieval logic.
✖️ May not handle complex queries well if the retrieved documents are not relevant.

🚀 Which One Should You Use?
Use Retriever + Chain Chatbot if you need fine-tuned retrieval & response generation.
Use Normal RAG Chatbot if you want a quick, easy-to-build chatbot.
